This section demonstrates how to display information in a C# Windows Forms application using the Text property of a Label control.

In this example, the program assigns the value stored in the fullname variable to the Text property of a Label control named lpdisplay.

The Label control is used to present information to the user without requiring them to enter or modify the displayed text.

How It Works

1. The program retrieves the full name stored in the fullname variable.
2. The .Text property of the Label control is accessed.
3. The full name is assigned to the Label.
4. The Label displays the user’s full name on the Windows Forms interface.

# ![alt text](<Clearing textboxes.png>)


This section demonstrates how to clear the contents of multiple TextBox controls in a C# Windows Forms application using the Clear() method.

In this example, the Clear() method is used to remove the text entered by the user from several TextBox controls.

Each TextBox is cleared individually by calling its Clear() method.

This functionality is useful when creating a Clear or Reset button that allows users to remove previously entered information and start again.

How It Works

1. The user enters information into the TextBox controls.
2. The program calls the Clear() method for each TextBox.
3. All existing text is removed from the specified controls.
4. The TextBoxes become empty and ready for new input.

> this section shows how to clear labepl control

note: when you want to clear label control you can not use clear() funtion in c#. but you can use other two ways of clearing. 
> assigning empty string or
> empty.string
you can use these two ways when you want to clear label control.


# ![explicit conversion](<Explicit conversion.png>)

> This section demonstrates how to convert text entered by the user into integer values using the int.Parse() method in a C# Windows Forms application.

In this example, the program retrieves numeric values from TextBox controls and converts them from strings into integers.

The Text property returns the input as a string, even when the user enters numeric characters.

The int.Parse() method converts a valid numeric string into an integer (int), allowing the program to perform mathematical operations using the values.

How It Works

1. The user enters numeric values into the TextBox controls.
2. The .Text property retrieves the entered values as strings.
3. The int.Parse() method converts the strings into integer values.
4. The converted values are assigned to their corresponding integer variables.
5. The integer variables can then be used in calculations and other operations.
